### Hey There!ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student at the Inter American University of Puerto Rico.
Initially, I started my college education studying to become a Pharmacy Technician. 
However, after I graduated, I decided to explore the field of computer science, where I discovered a new passion for coding and web development.
