# Hey there! 👋, I'm Nordiel  
### 🚀 Software Engineer | 💻 Tech Enthusiast  

I'm currently studying **Computer Science** at the **Inter American University of Puerto Rico** and working as a software engineer! My journey into tech started with a love for problem-solving and a knack for creativity, which I now channel into coding, web development, and learning new technologies.

- 🌟 **Fun fact**: I gratuated from a Pharmacy degree, but coding was way too much fun.   
- 🔭 **Currently working on**: Shhhhh...it's a secret 🤐 
- 🌱 **Learning**: Exploring the depths of Angular and NgRx.  
- 🎮 **Hobbies**: Gaming, trying out new tech, and occasionally binge-watching anime or any marvel series.
